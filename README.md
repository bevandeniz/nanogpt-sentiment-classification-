# Sentiment Classification using nanoGPT
* In this project, nanoGPT [1] by Andrej Karpathy was finetuned on a custom dataset called Customer Service Dataset which consists of diaoluges between a customer and an agent. 
* A pretrained nanoGPT model with GPT-2 weights was initialized and finetuned on the Customer Service Dataset.
* After obtaining meaningful embeddings, classification was performed using a linear model.
